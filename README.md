# AltspaceVR Programming Project - Shaders and Three.js

## Instructions
Use this project stub to implement a shader project using three.js framework.  
http://threejs.org/ is a WebGL library that is fast to pick up and quite powerful.

- The first part of the project is to implement a basic phong shader in this framework.  
- The second part of the project is to implement at least 1 interesting custom shader of your choice.
- The third part of the project is your choice of implementing more interesting custom shaders, or applying your custom shader from part 2 to a web app object in a cool way.


## Goals
We use this test to get a sense of your coding style and to how you creatively solve both a concrete problem and an abstract one. When we receive your project, here is what we will be asking ourselves:

- Is their phong shader correct?  Does it look correct and is the math behind the code correct?
- Are the other shaders and web app creative, challenging to implement, and just plain cool?
- Is the code well structured, easy to read and understand, and organized well?

This project should take approximately 5-15 hours to complete. To work on the project:
- Fork and clone the repo.
- Open shaders.html in your browser and see that it runs right.  Start modifying the code for your project.

This should be completed within a week of receiving these instructions (let us know if you have extenuating circumstances).

# Part 1 - Phong Shader

If you are new to Three.js, their example page is extremely helpful.
http://threejs.org/examples/
And there are some shader specific examples.

And here is a good crash course on writing shaders for Three.js.

You can also look at the diffuse shader provided in the project stub to help you get started.

Three.js does come with a Phong shader implementation, but please implement your own for the purposes of this project.  We want this to be an easy first step to the rest of the project.

# Part 2 - Your Choice of a Custom Shader

Play around and implement a cool shader that looks interesting.  
Some potential ideas:
- Lava shader
- Water shader
- Fur shader
- Toon shader
- TV scan lines shader
The possibilities are endless.

Add it to shaders.html as an option you can click to shade the geometry options.

# Part 3 - More Shaders, or Using Your Custom Shader

For this part, you can either write more custom shaders like in Part 2.

Or, you can augment shaders.html or create another webapp that uses the shader from Part 2 in a cool and interesting way.
Is there something that you think would be fun to implement for VR?  Can you use your shader to create a compelling scene or demo?
You can use external libraries and sourced assets here, but please note what they are.  Also keep in mind that we are looking at the code to evaluate based on the criteria above.  So using too much third-party code may make it harder for us to evaluate your work.

## Deliverable

In your repo, you should clobber this README file with your own describing your project. Any instructions or known issues should be documented in the README as well.

E-mail us a link to your Github repo to `projects@altvr.com`. Please include your contact information, and if you haven't submitted it to us already, your resume and cover letter. 

We hope you have fun working on the project, and we can't wait to see what you come up with!
